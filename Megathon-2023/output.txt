Great, I'd be happy to help you answer your question!
The symptoms of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) can vary depending on the location and size of the clot. Some common symptoms of DVT include:
* Pain or tenderness in the affected limb
* Swelling of the affected limb
* Warmth or redness of the affected limb
* Weakness or cramping in the affected muscles
* Shortness of breath or chest pain if the clot has traveled to the lungs (pulmonary embolism)

It's important to note that not everyone with DVT will experience symptoms, and some people may have no symptoms at all. If you suspect you or someone you know may have DVT, it's important to seek medical attention immediately.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
